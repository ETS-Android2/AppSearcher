# AppSearcher
In MIUI 13, Xiaomi began using Google Assistant instead of a convenient search application, I did not find an analogue and solved this problem in this way

This small application is designed to be installed as a desktop search, allows you to search and launch other applications.

In addition to the basic functionality, this application can:
- Save the last 5 running applications from it as quick access icons (just like in MIUI 12)
- Search for the entered text on the Internet, using Yandex (by default) or Google.
