In MIUI 13, Xiaomi began using Google Assistant instead of a convenient search application, I did not find an analogue and solved this problem in this way

This small application is designed to be installed as a desktop search, allows you to search and launch other applications.

In addition to the basic functionality, this application:
- Save the last 5 running applications from it as quick access icons (just like in MIUI 12)
- Search for the entered text on the Internet, using Yandex (by default) or Google.
- Search in contacts
- Uses cache for fast open

Notes:
- The first launch, as well as the cache reload when enabling or disabling options, will take longer than a normal launch
- Pressing Enter on the keyboard opens the first item in the list
- Long press on the quick launch icon removes the element
- If you haven't found a recently installed app or a recently added contact, click "Reload cache"
